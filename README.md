# About this site
This is brannan.cloud, the root domain for all my things, hosting everything from this website to the TV application in my grandma's living room.

Yup, you're right! And that's all it needs to be. A core software philosophy of mine is using only the minimum needed to get the job *(you better have a million-dollar reason not to!)*.

All this site does is tell you a little about me and offers a few links to some other sites. Though I do work with Next.js and React, there's no need for large interface libraries or hosting solutions for this little website. Basic HTML with vanilla CSS and JavaScript is fine.
