        <span>Hello!</span> This is brannan.cloud, the root domain for all my services, hosting everything
        from the website you see here to the TV application in my grandma's living room.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a full-time software developer, a prior U.S. Marine, and as is tradition of all people
        that doing with computers, my family's tech support.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is a little ugly right now, but I'm working on it. I'm currently moving it over to SvelteKit to match the rest of my projects and to hopefully make it a little easier to maintain.
